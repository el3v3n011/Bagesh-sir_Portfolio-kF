Hello and welcome! I am <strong>Dr.Bagesh Kumar, 
</strong>
an Assistant Professor and Faculty Placement Coordinator at <strong> Manipal Institute of Technology. </strong> With a <strong> 
masterâ€™s </strong>and <strong> 
Ph.D</strong> from <strong> IIIT-Allahabad,</strong> under the mentorship of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/om-prakash-vyas-5a649a6/"> <strong>Professor O.P. Vyas </strong></a> , my academic journey has been marked by a profound exploration of artificial intelligence and machine learning. 
<br>
<br>
My research contributions span various projects and publications, reflecting a dedication to innovation and excellence. Notable among these are projects like <strong?> "Cyber-Physical Security in Energy Infrastructure of Smart Cities (CPSEC)" </strong> and <strong> "Risk Averse Resilience Framework for Critical Infrastructure Security, </strong>" both funded by the <strong>Department of Science and Technology (DST), India. </strong>
Collaborating with esteemed institutions such as the <strong> Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) </strong> and <strong> Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (IITK), </strong> these projects aimed to fortify the security framework of smart cities and critical infrastructure, showcasing the interdisciplinary nature of my work. 
<br>
<br>
 

In terms of publications, my research covers a wide array of topics, including optimized algorithms for <strong> support vector machines (SVMs) </strong> and advanced applications such as textual description generation using Transformer models. Some of my notable publications include papers on classification using <strong> Modified Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) for One-Class Slab Support Vector Machine (OCSSVM) </strong> and an <strong> Optimized Parallel Training Algorithm for One-Class Support Vector Machine,</strong> among others. 
<br>
